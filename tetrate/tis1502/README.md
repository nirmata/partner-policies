# Prevent Duplicate Gateway Addresses
## Overview
The `prevent-duplicate-gateway-address` policy is a Kyverno ClusterPolicy designed to prevent the creation of Gateway resources with duplicate address and type combinations. This policy ensures that no two Gateways can be created with the same IP address and type, which could lead to conflicts and undefined behavior in the service mesh.

The policy specifically:
- Validates that new Gateway resources don't have address conflicts with existing Gateways
- Checks for duplicate IPAddress type addresses across all Gateways
- Prevents creation of Gateways that would cause address conflicts

## Usage
To apply this policy, ensure you have Kyverno installed in your Kubernetes cluster and apply the YAML configuration using:
```bash
kubectl apply -f prevent-duplicate-gateway-address.yaml
```

## Conclusion
Preventing duplicate Gateway addresses is crucial for maintaining a reliable service mesh. This Kyverno policy ensures that all Gateways have unique address and type combinations, preventing potential conflicts and undefined behavior in traffic routing.
