# Block Mesh Tracing Configuration in Istio ConfigMap
## Overview
The `check-istio-configmap-tracing` policy is a Kyverno ClusterPolicy designed to prevent the use of tracing configuration within the Istio ConfigMap mesh configuration. This policy enforces the use of the modern Telemetry API for configuring tracing in Istio, as the older mesh.tracing configuration pattern may be deprecated in future releases.

The policy specifically:
- Blocks tracing configuration in the Istio ConfigMap
- Applies to the istio-system namespace
- Targets the 'istio' ConfigMap
- Promotes the use of the Telemetry API for tracing configuration

## Usage
To apply this policy, ensure you have Kyverno installed in your Kubernetes cluster and apply the YAML configuration using:
```bash
kubectl apply -f check-istio-configmap-tracing.yaml
```

TIS0902 - Mesh Tracing Configuration in ConfigMap
This guidance from Tetrate outlines the deprecation of mesh.tracing configuration in Istio ConfigMap and recommends using the Telemetry API for tracing configuration.

## Conclusion
Using the modern Telemetry API for tracing configuration is crucial for maintaining a future-proof service mesh. This Kyverno policy ensures that tracing is configured using the recommended approach, preventing the use of potentially deprecated configuration patterns and maintaining compatibility with future Istio releases.
