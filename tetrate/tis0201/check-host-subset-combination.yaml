    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Detects and prevents the creation of multiple DestinationRule objects with the same host and subset combination.
      Overlapping configurations can lead to unpredictable routing behavior in Istio as the control plane may not reliably choose between conflicting rules.
      This policy enforces uniqueness of the (host, subset) pairing across DestinationRules to avoid errors like TIS0201 reported by Istio analyzers.
      Use a single DestinationRule per host-subset pair, or split subsets distinctly across different rules to ensure safe and consistent traffic policies.
