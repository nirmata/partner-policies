# Prevent Overlapping DestinationRules

## Overview

The `prevent-overlapping-destinationrules` policy is a Kyverno ClusterPolicy designed to enforce unique host-subset combinations across DestinationRule objects in your Istio service mesh. This policy prevents the creation of multiple DestinationRules with overlapping configurations that could lead to unpredictable routing behavior.

The policy specifically:

-   Validates that each DestinationRule has unique host-subset combinations
-   Prevents creation of DestinationRules with conflicting subset names for the same host
-   Helps avoid routing conflicts and unpredictable behavior in the service mesh
-   Provides clear error messages when validation fails

## Usage

To apply this policy, ensure you have Kyverno installed in your Kubernetes cluster and apply the YAML configuration using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f check-host-subset-combination.yaml
```

## Conclusion

Maintaining unique host-subset combinations in DestinationRules is crucial for ensuring predictable routing behavior in your service mesh. This Kyverno policy helps prevent configuration conflicts that could lead to routing errors and service disruptions.
