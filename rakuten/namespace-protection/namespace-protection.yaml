    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Cases where RBAC may be applied at a higher level and where Namespace-level
      protections may be necessary can be accomplished with a separate policy. For example,
      one may want to protect updates and deletes on only a single Namespace. This
      policy will block updates and deletes to any Namespace labeled with `freeze=true`.
      Caution should be exercised when using rules which match on all kinds (`"*"`) as this will
      involve, for larger clusters, a substantial amount of processing on Kyverno's part. Additional
      resource requests and/or limits may be required.
