# Enforce Fault Domain and Backup for Replication 1

## Overview
This Kyverno policy is designed to ensure that when PersistentVolumes (PVs) are configured with a replication factor of 1, they include necessary fault domain and backup configurations. This is crucial for preventing data loss and ensuring high availability.


## Key Features
1. **Fault Domain Validation**:
   - Ensures that the `faultdomain` parameter is set to one of the following values: `disk`, `host`, or `rack` when the replication factor is set to 1.

2. **Backup or Snapshot Requirement**:
   - Requires that either a `snapshot_space_limit` is configured or a backup mechanism is in place when the replication factor is 1.

## Usage
To apply this policy, ensure that you have Kyverno installed in your Kubernetes cluster and apply the YAML configuration using the following command:
```bash
kubectl apply -f enforce-faultdomain-and-backup-for-replication-1.yaml
```

## Conclusion
This policy helps maintain data integrity and availability by enforcing best practices for PersistentVolume configurations in Kubernetes.
