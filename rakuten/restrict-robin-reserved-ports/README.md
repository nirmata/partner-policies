# Restrict Robin Reserved Ports Policy

## Overview

The `restrict-robin-reserved-ports` policy is a Kyverno ClusterPolicy designed to enforce security measures on Kubernetes Pods and Services. This policy ensures that only Pods and Services with the exact Robin labels are allowed to use the reserved ports ranging from 29442 to 29470. Any attempt by other Pods or Services to utilize these ports will result in a denial.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this policy is to prevent unauthorized access to reserved ports, thereby enhancing the security posture of your Kubernetes environment. By restricting access to these ports, we can mitigate potential conflicts and ensure that only designated applications can communicate over these channels.


## Usage

To apply this policy, ensure that you have Kyverno installed in your Kubernetes cluster. You can apply the policy using the following command:
```bash
kubectl apply -f path/to/restrict-robin-reserved-ports.yaml
```

## Conclusion

This policy is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of your Kubernetes applications by ensuring that only authorized Pods and Services can access specific reserved ports. Regularly review and update the policy as necessary to adapt to changes in your application architecture or security requirements.
